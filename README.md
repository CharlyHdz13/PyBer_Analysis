# Analysis of Rides, Fares and Drivers based on city type for PyBer
## Overview of the analysis
Inside the following I will be going through all the important aspects to take into consideration for PyBer regarding their different types of pricing for different city types for the period of January 2019 to April 2019. I will be explaining this with visual representations of the data retrieved and perhaps get some insight into areas to improve on.
## Results
Firstly, I grouped tha important data to be analyzed inside a table.

From this table there is a clear increase in the number of total drivers and rides in the most populated areas, which is normal. What is interesting here is that in the "Rural" and "Suburban" areas we have more rides than drivers, which means that their is more demand than supply. This is beneficial for PyBer because they are able to move more freely the price on the rides. This can be seen clearly in the "Average Fare per Ride" and "Average Fare per Driver" for these areas being much higher than for the "Urban" area. In the "Urban" area we have the opposite, here we have an way more drivers than rides. This brings down the fares perhaps hitting a bit our revenue. This may also be caused due to the large amount of companies that give the same service as PyBer. 

Moving on further with the analysis, now I will be analysing the total fare by each city type for the period of January 2019 - April 2019. For this we can use the following table and graph:

The table enables us to reference certain dates and the accurate values, but for the analysis I will be focusing more on the graph. From the graph, it is shown that the trends tend to stay around the same values for this period of time for each city type. Yes, there are fluctuations but there are no drastic uplifts or downfalls for each city type. Also we do not have any information on PyBer's policies or campaigns that occurred during this time or any big relevant events that occured during this time that can help us better understand the why of this graphs. Aside from the fact that from January to the end of February there was an overall increase in fares in the three city types.

## Summary
Based on the results, I would recommend an increase in the amount of drivers for the "Rural" and "Suburban" areas in order to increase revenue. Also I would look onto the frequency each driver makes a drive in the "Urban" area, is it high or low? If it is high then mantaining or increasing the number of drivers here is important. On the other hand if it is low then reduce the number of drivers, in order to have less idle drivers. Finally, I suggest taking a deep dive to see what happened during January and February to see why suddenly this little increase was stopped and started fluctuating.
